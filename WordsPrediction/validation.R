# Cross validation to optimise and then test the model
# Strategy
# Due to limitation in space. The size of the corpus will not be changed as a first option
# Try to optimise the discount factor first
# Use the perplexity, for a given sentence, calculate the possibility to made up that sentence from the probability in the training set
